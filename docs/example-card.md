## Example Button Component
Here is an example of the product card component. For right now we are not concerened about styling that will come later.


```jsx
  <aside>
          <img src="shoes.jpg" alt="pair of shoes" />
          <header>
            <h2>Product Name</h2>
            <p>$129.25</p>
          </header>
           <hr />
           <p>The RC3 is loaded with top of the line features that make it a high performance shoe at a mid-level price. Designed for both comfort and speed, the RC3 will help you to keep riding strongly as you push your limits.</p>
           <footer>
            <button>BUY NOW</button>
           </footer>
         </aside>
```
